## Overview

- This project is built using the Next.js framework and React to deliver a highly responsive and performant user interface.

- The core layout is defined in `src/app/layout.js`, where we utilize `next/font` for font optimization, set the title and description for SEO, and apply a solid base styling for a polished look and feel.

- Our dynamic homepage is beautifully rendered from `src/app/page.js`, designed to engage users from the moment they land on the site.

- Consistent styling is maintained throughout the application thanks to `globals.css`, ensuring a visually appealing and coherent user experience.

- We've incorporated SVG icons for a visually pleasing touch, like the eye-catching Apple Store icon, defined in `public/appleStoreIcon.svg`.
